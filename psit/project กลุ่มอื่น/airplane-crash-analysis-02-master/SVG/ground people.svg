The PSA was descending and about to land at Lindbergh Field. The Cessna was climbing while engaged in practice approaches. The 727 overtook and struck the Cessna from the rear. The primary cause was the PSA crew lost sight of the Cessna and did not make that fact known to the ATC.  The ATC failed to realize from the PSA transmissions that they lost sight of the Cessna. One hundred thirty-five killed on the PSA, two on the Cessna and seven on the ground. Crew fatigue may have played a part in the accident as there are unofficial reports that the crew attended an all night party and had only 2 hours sleep from the night before.</title></g><g class="guides"><path class="guide line" d="M541.756250 0.000000 v374.000000"/><text class="" x="541.75625" y="389.0" transform="rotate(90 541.756250 389.000000)">In 1998 On flight 676 : â¦</text><title>In 1998 On flight 676 : The aircraft was attempting to land at Taipei's international airport in rain and fog when the crew requested a go-around.
